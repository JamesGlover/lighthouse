    Note: The labwhere API currently identifies users by their swipecard, however
    currently we only have access to the login when generating plate events.
    We can use the robot as a user instead, this has the advantage that:
      1) Its not open to user error
      2) There is reduced risk that the robot is not registered in labwhere
      3) We wont ascribe unloading the robot to the same user who loaded it
      4) It will not require changes to labwhere or additional user id validation

    Arguments:
        labware_barcodes {List[str]} - The source plate barcodes
        location_barcode {str} - The barcode of the locations to which the labwares have been transferred.
        user_barcode {str} - The swipecard/barcode for the user or robot associated with the scan.
